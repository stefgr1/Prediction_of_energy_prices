[I 2024-11-03 15:27:29,592] A new study created in memory with name: no-name-99b8ccb0-4c72-4d23-986e-51f8640fdfa4
/pfs/data5/home/tu/tu_tu/tu_zxoul27/micromamba/envs/power/lib/python3.12/site-packages/torch/random.py:167: UserWarning: CUDA reports that you have 2 available devices, and you have used fork_rng without explicitly specifying which devices are being used. For safety, we initialize *every* CUDA device by default, which can be quite slow if you have a lot of CUDAs. If you know that you are only making use of a few CUDA devices, set the environment variable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES or the 'devices' keyword argument of fork_rng with the set of devices you are actually using. For example, if you are using CPU only, set device.upper()_VISIBLE_DEVICES= or devices=[]; if you are using device 0 only, set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 or devices=[0].  To initialize all devices and suppress this warning, set the 'devices' keyword argument to `range(torch.cuda.device_count())`.
